    "SQL databases are best suited for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial applications, e-commerce sites, and enterprise-level systems.\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are based on non-relational models of data, where data is stored in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are more flexible than SQL databases, as they allow for faster and easier scalability and can handle large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema, so they can be easily adapted to changing data requirements.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are best suited for applications that require high availability, fast performance, and scalability, such as social media, gaming, and IoT applications.\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Couchbase, Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB."
