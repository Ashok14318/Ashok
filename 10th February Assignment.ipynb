    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (read only mode): This is the default mode, which opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (write mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated (i.e., deleted). If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (append mode): This mode opens the file for writing, but unlike write mode, it appends data to the end of the file if it already exists. If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file for writing. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (binary mode): This mode is used to open a binary file, such as an image or a video. The data is read and written in binary format, not as text. This mode can be combined with other modes, e.g., 'rb' for reading a binary file and 'wb' for writing a binary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (read and write mode): This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. This mode can be combined with other modes, e.g., 'r+' for reading and writing an existing file, 'w+' for writing and reading a file (the file is truncated if it already exists), and 'a+' for appending and reading a file."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "soln:\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function is used to close an open file. Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Releasing system resources: When a file is open, the operating system assigns resources to it, such as memory and disk space. By closing the file, you release these resources, making them available for other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring data integrity: When you write to a file, the data may not be immediately written to disk. Closing the file ensures that all data has been flushed to disk, so you can be sure that the contents of the file are up-to-date and complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing corruption: If you don't close a file, and your program crashes or terminates abnormally, the file may be left in an inconsistent state, leading to data corruption. Closing the file ensures that the file is properly closed and any changes are committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper use of files: In general, it is good practice to close a file as soon as you are done using it. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain, and helps you avoid running into problems such as reaching the maximum number of open files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, closing a file is a necessary step to ensure that your data is stored properly, and that system resources are used efficiently."
